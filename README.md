Hey, I’m Pathwa! I’m interested in C, Unix/Linux, and Java.
I’m currently learning about Minecraft Seed Generation and how to predict these generations to your advantage.
Don't have a soild form of contact yet but will update this when I do.
Other than that feel free to leave feedback or modify my projects. I'm still learing and would love any advice.
